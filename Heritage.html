                    <h2>1955: The Founding Vision</h2>
                    <p>In a small workshop in the heart of Germany's Black Forest, master watchmaker Klaus Richter pursued a singular vision: to create timepieces that would not just tell time, but transcend it. While others worked with gold and steel, Richter was captivated by platinum. He saw its rarity, purity, and permanence as the ultimate expression of horological art. In 1955, he founded his workshop, dedicating it exclusively to the craft of platinum watchmaking—a bold and unprecedented move at the time.</p>

                    <h2>A Commitment to the Platinum Standard</h2>
                    <p>Working with platinum required new techniques and immense skill. Its density and high melting point made it notoriously difficult to machine and polish. Richter and his small team of artisans spent years perfecting their methods, developing proprietary tools and processes. This relentless dedication established the "Platinum Standard" that defines our brand to this day. Every watch that leaves our manufactory is a testament to this uncompromising commitment to quality.</p>

                <div class="page-item">
                    <h2>Generations of Craftsmanship</h2>
                    <p>The skills honed by Klaus Richter were passed down to his son, and then to his grandson. Our workshop has grown, but our philosophy remains unchanged. We blend time-honored techniques—like hand-polishing cases and meticulously decorating movements—with state-of-the-art precision engineering. This fusion of old and new allows us to create watches that are both technically superior and imbued with a human touch.</p>

                    <h2>Our Philosophy Today</h2>
                    <p>Today, German Platinum Watches remains an independent, family-owned company. We are not driven by market trends or production quotas. We are driven by a passion to create the world's finest platinum timepieces. We believe a watch is more than an accessory; it is a personal legacy, an heirloom to be passed down through generations. When you wear one of our watches, you are wearing a piece of our history and a symbol of enduring value.</p>
